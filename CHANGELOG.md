# Changelog

Every release of MICO360 Tasks: the web portal and its server, the Android app and the Chrome
extension, which share one version number.

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (Major.Minor.Patch):
- a **major** release (2.0.0) changes something people or other systems rely on (marked BREAKING);
- a **minor** release (1.1.0) adds new features;
- a **patch** release (1.0.1) improves, secures or fixes what is there.

List each change under **[Unreleased]** as it is made, in one of four sections: New features,
Improvements, Security, Bug fixes. `node tools/release/release.mjs` then turns them into the next
version (see [docs/RELEASES.md](docs/RELEASES.md)). Security entries are shown to administrators only.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-17

  Tasks, and a task panel with checklist, comments with @mentions, files, dependencies, watchers and
  the full history of changes.
- Recurring tasks: daily, weekly on chosen days, monthly or quarterly (a date or "the 2nd Tuesday"),
  yearly, ending never, after a number of times or on a date, and pausable.
- Milestones: mark a task as a milestone; boards, the task panel and the project dashboard flag it.
- Projects with a number, a picture or icon, a team and a dashboard: overview and timeline,
  milestones, deadlines, tasks by phase, meetings, decisions and action items, and the team.
- Meetings: agenda, notes, attendees with replies to invitations, calendar invitations, minutes as
  PDF, final minutes drafted by AI and approved by the organizer, and action items.
- Repeating meetings: daily, weekly on chosen days, monthly or custom, with changes to one meeting or
  all upcoming ones, kept in step with invitees' calendars.

  own week start and time zone.
- Chat: project channels and direct messages, with replies, reactions, files and read receipts.
- Notifications in the app, by email and on phones, with each person's choice of what they receive.
- Reports on status, project performance, workload and completion, exported as Excel, PDF or CSV.
- AI help: describe a task in plain English, break a task into steps, suggest its priority, and
  summarize a project; administrators choose the AI provider and model in AI Management.
- Search everything, or jump to any page, from one box (Ctrl+K).
- Keyboard shortcuts for saving, submitting, searching, adding, editing, deleting, cancelling and
  refreshing, listed with Ctrl+/.
- The version and when it was last updated in every page's footer, and this version history under
  About.
- Sign in with a password or a code sent by email; forgotten passwords are reset by email.
- Administration: user management, system settings and audit logs.
- An Android app, a Chrome extension, a self-contained Windows server for an office, and the web
  server at task.mico360.com.

### Improvements
- Every page works on phones and tablets, including with the on-screen keyboard open.
- Changes made by others appear live on boards, meetings, chat and dashboards.
- Changes made while offline are kept and sent when the connection returns.
- Dates and times follow the company's time zone (Oman time).
- Keyboard and screen-reader access throughout, checked with automated accessibility tests.

### Security
- Accounts lock after five failed sign-ins; sign-in tokens are rotated and stored only as hashes.
- A suspended, deleted or demoted user loses access at once, not when their session ends.
- Every request is checked against the person's role and project membership.
- Security headers, an allow-list of web origins, rate limits, and checks on uploaded files' type
  and size.
- Administrators' changes are recorded in the audit log.

### Bug fixes
- More than 150 problems found in code reviews, audits and testing before this release were fixed,
  among them repeating meetings that could move a week late, calendar updates that skipped
  invitees, and dialogs that could not be reached on small screens.
